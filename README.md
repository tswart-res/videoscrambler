# videoscrambler

This script can be used to randomly scramble the content of a video. Some example uses would be to overcome ASMR immunity to certain favourite videos where repeated watching + exposure has led to diminishing returns of ASMR. The code relies on ffmpeg to edit the videos and python to scramble. Default scrambling is 5 second chunks.
